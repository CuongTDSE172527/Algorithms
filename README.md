## Introduction

This project aims to provide a visual representation of common sorting algorithms implemented in C++. By visualizing these algorithms, users can gain a better understanding of how they work and compare their performance.

## Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort (if implemented)
- Shell Sort (if implemented)
- Counting Sort (if implemented)

## Technologies Used

- C++ programming language
- Jetbrains Clion
